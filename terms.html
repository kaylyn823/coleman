                                    at the match, or in the middle of a music festival. We're always around a place where
                                    there are friends, coolers, and campfires. So, grab a tent, fire up a grill, and
                                    pull up a chair. The Outside Is Calling. Answer it.

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these to the Terms of Use, this website, or any products or services sold or distributed by or through this website, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the Terms of Use. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. THIS PROVISION IS VOID, INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
